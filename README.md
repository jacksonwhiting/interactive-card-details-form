## My process

### Built with

-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  Tailwind CSS
-  Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I'll continue practicing working with forms and form validation on the client side. I found it a bit challenging at first to use a gradient color for the input outline. I'm sure there are many ways to tackle this but I created a div behind the input with a gradient background. I sized the div to be a bit larger than the input thus giving the apperance of an outline.

### Continued development

Continue getting more proficient with forms and form validation.
